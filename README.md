## Configurable Research Agents

BioAgents allows you to choose your primary literature and analysis agents. While multiple backends are supported, **BIO** is the recommended default:

| Agent Type | Primary (BIO) | Alternative |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Literature** | BioAgents Literature API - semantic search with LLM reranking | OpenScholar, Edison |
| **Analysis** | BioAgents Data Analysis - state-of-the-art benchmark performance | Edison |

Configure your preferred agents in `.env`:
```bash
PRIMARY_LITERATURE_AGENT=bio    # or openscholar, edison
PRIMARY_ANALYSIS_AGENT=bio      # or edison
```

### Routes

The system operates through two main routes:

- **[/api/chat](src/routes/chat.ts)** - Agent-based chat for general research questions with automatic literature search
- **[/api/deep-research](src/routes/deep-research/)** - Deep research mode with iterative hypothesis-driven investigation

**Chat diagram**

**Deep research diagram**
<img width="1999" height="878" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87afd02c-9476-45d0-8ac0-66ac8b590e35" />


Both routes use the same agent architecture but differ in their orchestration and iteration patterns.

### Agents

**Agents** are the core concept in this repository. Each agent is a self-contained, independent function that performs a specific task in the research workflow. Agents are designed to be modular and reusable across different routes and contexts.

#### Available Agents

   - Submits a cryptographically-committed attestation to the ValiChord peer network
   - Supports all disciplines: ComputationalBiology, MachineLearning, Neuroscience, and more
   - Honest-by-design: FailedToReproduce with High confidence is more valuable than a spurious pass
   - Exposed via `POST /api/valichord/validate`
   - Requires `VALICHORD_API_URL` pointing to a running ValiChord bridge instance

#### Adding New Agents

To add a new agent:

1. Create a folder in `src/agents/`
2. Implement the main agent function in `index.ts`
3. Add supporting logic in separate files within the folder
4. Export the agent function for use in routes
5. Shared utilities go in [src/utils](src/utils)

### State Management

State is separated into two types:

**Message State** (`State`):

- Ephemeral, tied to a single message
- Contains processing details for that message only
- Automatically cleared after processing
- Used for temporary data like raw file buffers

**Conversation State** (`ConversationState`):

- Persistent across the entire conversation
- Contains cumulative research data:
  - Uploaded datasets with descriptions
  - Current plan and completed tasks
  - Key insights and discoveries
  - Current hypothesis and methodology
  - Research objectives
- Stored in database and maintained across requests
- This is the primary state that drives the research workflow

### LLM Library

The [LLM library](src/llm) provides a unified interface for multiple LLM providers. It allows you to use any Anthropic/OpenAI/Google or OpenRouter LLM via the [same interface](src/llm/provider.ts). Examples of calling the LLM library can be found in all agents.

**Key Features:**

- Unified API across providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter)
- Extended thinking support for Anthropic models
- System instruction support
- Streaming and non-streaming responses
- Examples in every agent implementation

### Literature Agent & Knowledge Base

The Literature Agent includes multiple search backends:

**OPENSCHOLAR (Optional):**

- General scientific literature search with high-quality citations
- Requires custom deployment and configuration
- Set `OPENSCHOLAR_API_URL` and `OPENSCHOLAR_API_KEY` to enable
- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14199
- Deployment: https://github.com/bio-xyz/bio-openscholar

**EDISON (Optional):**

- Edison AI literature search (deep research mode only)
- Requires custom deployment and configuration
- Set `EDISON_API_URL` and `EDISON_API_KEY` to enable
- Deployment: https://github.com/bio-xyz/bio-edison-api

**KNOWLEDGE (Customizable):**

- Vector database with semantic search ([embeddings](src/embeddings))
- Cohere reranker for improved results (requires `COHERE_API_KEY`)
- Document processing from [docs directory](docs)
- Documents are processed once per filename and stored in vector DB

**To add custom knowledge:**

1. Place documents in the `docs/` directory
   - Supported formats: PDF, Markdown (.md), DOCX, TXT
2. Documents are automatically processed on startup
3. Vector embeddings are generated and stored
4. Available to Literature Agent via KNOWLEDGE tasks

**Docker Deployment Note**: When deploying with Docker, agent-specific documentation in `docs/` and branding images in `client/public/images/` are persisted using Docker volumes. These directories are excluded from git (see `.gitignore`) but automatically mounted in your Docker containers via volume mounts defined in `docker-compose.yml`. This allows you to customize your agent with private documentation without committing it to the repository.

### Analysis Agent Configuration

The Analysis Agent supports two backends for data analysis:

**EDISON (Default):**

- Deep analysis via Edison AI agent
- Automatic file upload to Edison storage service
- Requires `EDISON_API_URL` and `EDISON_API_KEY`
- https://github.com/bio-xyz/bio-edison-api

**BIO (Alternative):**

- Basic analysis via BioAgents Data Analysis Agent
- Set `PRIMARY_ANALYSIS_AGENT=bio` in `.env`
- Requires `DATA_ANALYSIS_API_URL` and `DATA_ANALYSIS_API_KEY`
- https://github.com/bio-xyz/bio-data-analysis

Both backends receive datasets and analysis objectives, execute analysis code, and return results.

### Character File

The [character file](src/character.ts) defines your agent's identity and system instructions. It's now simplified to focus on core behavior:

- **name**: Your agent's name
- **system**: System prompt that guides agent behavior across all interactions

The character's system instruction is automatically included in LLM calls for planning, hypothesis generation, and replies, ensuring consistent behavior throughout the research workflow. You can enable the system prompt in any LLM call by setting the 'systemInstruction' parameter.

## UI

**Component system:**

- Custom hooks in `client/src/hooks/`
- UI components in `client/src/components/ui/`
- Lucide icons via `client/src/components/icons/`

**Styling:**

- Main styles: `client/src/styles/global.css`
- Button styles: `client/src/styles/buttons.css`
- Mobile-first responsive design

**Payment Integration:**

The UI includes integrated support for x402 micropayments using Coinbase embedded wallets:

- Embedded wallet authentication via `client/src/components/EmbeddedWalletAuth.tsx`
- x402 payment hooks in `client/src/hooks/useX402Payment.ts`
- Seamless USDC payment flow for paid API requests
- Toast notifications for payment status

## Authentication

BioAgents supports two independent auth systems:

| Setting | Options | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| `AUTH_MODE` | `none` / `jwt` | JWT authentication for external frontends |
| `X402_ENABLED` | `true` / `false` | x402 USDC micropayments |

### JWT Authentication (Production)

For external frontends connecting to the API:

```bash
# .env
AUTH_MODE=jwt
BIOAGENTS_SECRET=your-secure-secret  # Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
```

Your backend signs JWTs with the shared secret:

```javascript
// Your backend generates JWT for authenticated users
const jwt = await new jose.SignJWT({ sub: userId })  // sub must be valid UUID
  .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'HS256' })
  .setExpirationTime('1h')
  .sign(new TextEncoder().encode(process.env.BIOAGENTS_SECRET));

// Call BioAgents API
fetch('https://your-bioagents-api/api/chat', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${jwt}` },
  body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'What is rapamycin?' })
});
```

**📖 See [AUTH.md](documentation/docs/AUTH.md) for complete JWT integration guide**

### x402 Payment Protocol (Optional)

For pay-per-request access using USDC micropayments:

```bash
# .env
X402_ENABLED=true
X402_ENVIRONMENT=testnet  # or mainnet
X402_PAYMENT_ADDRESS=0xYourWalletAddress
```

**📖 See [AUTH.md](documentation/docs/AUTH.md) for x402 configuration details**

## Job Queue (Production)

BioAgents supports BullMQ for reliable background job processing with:

- **Horizontal scaling**: Run multiple worker instances
- **Job persistence**: Jobs survive server restarts
- **Automatic retries**: Failed jobs retry with exponential backoff
- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket notifications for job progress
- **Admin dashboard**: Bull Board UI at `/admin/queues`

```bash
# Enable job queue
USE_JOB_QUEUE=true
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Start API server and worker separately
bun run dev      # API server
bun run worker   # Worker process
```

**📖 See [JOB_QUEUE.md](documentation/docs/JOB_QUEUE.md) for complete setup and configuration guide**

## ValiChord Integration — AI Reproducibility Validator

BioAgents can act as an AI validator in the [ValiChord](https://github.com/topeuph-ai/ValiChord)
peer reproducibility protocol. ValiChord asks: *can an independent party arrive at the same
result as the researcher?* BioAgents answers that question autonomously.

> **ValiChord is not a blockchain.** It is an agent-centric distributed network where each
> node maintains its own cryptographically-signed source chain. There are no miners, no tokens,
> and no global consensus — only peer-to-peer attestation.

### How It Works

1. **Deposit arrives** — a researcher submits a study deposit (code + data ZIP) to ValiChord.
2. **BioAgents validates** — `POST /api/valichord/validate` triggers the ValiChord Validator Agent.
3. **AI reproduces** — BioAgents downloads the deposit, inspects the code, and attempts to
   reproduce the key findings using its analysis capabilities.
4. **Attestation submitted** — the agent submits a verdict (`Reproduced` / `PartiallyReproduced` /
   `FailedToReproduce`) with confidence level and detailed notes to the ValiChord bridge API,
   which commits it to the peer network.

The attestation is honest by design: "Reproduced" means BioAgents obtained the **same result**
as the researcher — not that the result is scientifically correct.

### Setup

1. Clone and run the ValiChord bridge API locally:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/ValiChord/backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   flask run  # starts at http://localhost:5000
   ```

2. Add to your `.env`:
   ```bash
   VALICHORD_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   VALICHORD_API_KEY=              # leave empty for local dev
   ```

### API

**`POST /api/valichord/validate`**

```json
{
  "depositUrl": "https://osf.io/abc123/download",
  "discipline": { "type": "ComputationalBiology" },
  "studyDescription": "Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data comparing treatment vs control"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "data_hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c...",
  "outcome": "Reproduced",
  "confidence": "High",
  "notes": "Ran main_analysis.R; all 47 p-values reproduced within floating point tolerance.",
  "validator_attested": true,
  "harmony_record_hash": "uhCkk...",
  "harmony_record_url": "https://...",
  "start": "2026-04-21T10:00:00Z",
  "end": "2026-04-21T10:03:42Z"
}
```

Supported disciplines: `ComputationalBiology`, `ClimateScience`, `SocialScience`,
`Economics`, `Psychology`, `Neuroscience`, `MachineLearning`, `Other`.

### Claude Code Skill

The integration includes a `.claude/skills/valichord-validator/` skill that teaches
Claude Code how to validate deposits end-to-end. The skill is invoked automatically
by `callAnthropicWithSkills` and handles:

- Download + SHA-256 hashing of the deposit
- File classification (scripts, data, README, environment files)
- Attempt to reproduce findings using `Bash`, `Read`, and `Grep` tools
- Submission to the ValiChord bridge API via the bundled `valichord_bridge.py` script
